Here I have given the BAO data and corresponding error. I have not given the covariance matrix. 
I have shown how to calculate the several observables particularly: D_M, D_L, D_V and using that you can fit your cosmological model keep r_d that is standard ruler at drag epoch (baryon photon decouple, z_d = 1060). 
The planck estimated the length to be near 147 KPc. This length must be greater than the r_s standard ruler at recombination epoch z= 1100. It is important to note that both these quantities are different and measured at different time scalae.
