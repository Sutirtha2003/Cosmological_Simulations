[1] For OHD data analysis with the LamdaCDM mdoel watch my tutorial here: https://youtu.be/0GDzoKncNO4 

[2] For the analysis of Supernova Pantheon+ data sets, watch my tutorial here: https://youtu.be/u88Goguzm9M

⚠️Note: While using the covariance matrix (after downloading from panthon+ website), you will probably get an error due to its shape. In order to resolve that you must follow the steps before reshaping. Open the file.cov in the vs code or any text editior, remove the first line written (1701) and save it. Now you can use the file for your calculation.
